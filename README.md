# Unit 11: Machine Learning

For this homework, I was asked to evaluate lending data for a peer-to-peer lending service. I used two primary methods in order to do this: resampling and ensemble learning. In my case, I had much better luck with the latter. For the former, I used the following algorithms to assess the data: Naive Random Oversampler, SMOTE, Cluster Centroids and SMOTEENN. In addition, I used logistic regression classifier, balanced accuracy score, confusion matrix and imbalanced classification report as part of this evaluation. For the latter, I used the Balanced Random Forest Classifier and the Easy Ensemble Classifier algorithms to evaluate a Q1 2019 lending dataset. I found this part easier because the output made more sense. As you will see from my code, the resampling results for the latter are almost too good to be true. This indicates to me that I implimented the algorithms incorrectly. I plan to ask the instructor about this during office hours next week. All answers to the quesstions are contained in their respective notebook files.

Note to the central grader: I had some issues with having enough memory, however this was solved by zipping the CSV file. Do not under any circumstances run my code using the unzipped CSV file. You will run out of memory.
